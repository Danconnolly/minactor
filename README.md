# minactor

This is going to be a minimal actor framework in Rust, specifically for the tokio runtime.

I've looked at several other Rust actor implementations and they're mostly huge things with a bunch of features
that I don't need or want. I need something minimal, something lean. I'm going to start by importing an ad-hoc
implementation that I wrote in another project.
